ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @geko83 and I'm currently learning the NodeJS technology.
I'm also creating my first web application that I would like to release by the end of this year, 2021, hopefully!
I would like to learn more, but it takes lot of free time.
When I will deploy my web app, I will need also to create a mobile phone app based on that.
Stay tuned! ;-)
